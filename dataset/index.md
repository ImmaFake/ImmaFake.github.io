# Lifelong Robotic Vision Dataset

We will provide a dataset, along with benchmarking tools, for the Lifelong Robotic Vision Competition on IROS 2019 and for any other research purpose. Currently we are collecting data by ourselves, but we welcome contribution of data from third parties, as long as the data are relevant to lifelong robotic vision research and are in a good enough quality. Please contact [Qi She](mailto:qi.she@intel.com) or [Xuesong Shi](mailto:xuesong.shi@intel.com) for either lifelong object recognition dataset (**OpenLORIS-Object**) or Lifelong SLAM dataset (**OpenLORIS-Scene**) contribution.

For the details of current lifelong object recognition and lifelong SLAM datasets, please follow their webpages:
